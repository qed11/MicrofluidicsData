# MicrofluidicsData
This repository consists the data obtained from each section of the lab, as well as a MATLAB program to count the pixels. 
For data related to straight channel, they can be found in Data_Straight.xlsx
For data related to different sized channels, they can be found in Data_Different_size.xlsx
For data replated to bended channels, they can be found in Data_Bend.xlsx.

In each of the files, calculation of velocity (mm/s), its error and standard deviation are shown. For the straight channel, additional figures and calculation of the fluid cross-sectional profile are performed.
